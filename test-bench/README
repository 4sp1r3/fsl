* Vulnerable web applications (DVWA, bWAPP, SQLI Labs, and SQLol)
* Shells (PHP Shell, ​b374k, ​Ani-Shell, and ​WSO PHP Shell)
* ​Helper tools (PHP Shell detector, ​linfo, and ​phpmyadmin)

The 'test-bench' directory contains everything that is needed by Ansible 
to configure a bare Fedora installation as FSL Test bench.
